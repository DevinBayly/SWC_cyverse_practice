importing and setup
```{r }

gap.in <- read.csv("http://naupaka.net/files/gapminder.csv")
View(gap.in)
```

ok now we are going to setup the dplyr stuff setting up librarie

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```
countries of interest here as a countries vector
``` {r}
my_countries <- c("China","Cambodia")
```

Now we are going to setup things up for some analysis first with filtering to get only my countries
```{r filtering
}
gap.in %>%
filter(country %in% my_countries) -> country_data
```
